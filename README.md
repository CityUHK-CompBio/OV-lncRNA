## Subtype-specific lncRNA ZFHX4-AS1 promotes invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer by interacting with HuR RNA binding protein to stabilize its antisense gene ZFHX4

### 1. Background
Ovarian cancer (OV) is a heterogeneous disease, posing a significant challenge to womenâ€™s health globally. Currently, the biological function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in different subtypes of OV remains poorly characterized. Among these subtypes, mesenchymal OV is the most aggressive subtype with unfavorable survival outcomes.   

### 2. Major findings   
We performed integrative network analysis to uncover the heterogeneity of lncRNAs in different OV subtypes. We identified ZFHX4-AS1 as a mesenchymal subtype-specific master regulator driving the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression of ZFHX4-AS1 is a predictor of poor patient survival. Silencing ZFHX4-AS1 inhibits OV cell viability, migration, EMT, and stemness properties in vitro and reduces metastasis of OV in vivo. Mechanistically, by binding to the RNA binding protein (RBP) HuR, ZFHX4-AS1 promotes the interaction of HuR and mRNA of the target antisense gene ZFHX4, leading to enhanced ZFHX4 expression.
